# Openplanet-Angelscript

IDE features + Language Server for [Openplanet](https://openplanet.dev) flavored angelscript.
This project is not maintained by the Openplanet team.

You must open at the root of a plugin directory (that contains an `info.toml` file).

Works in Windows and WSL. You don't need to use WSL. (it probably also works under linux and macos if you set config paths correctly, but those environments are unsupported. will help with issues if I can, but YMMV.)

Currently only the TMNEXT engine is supported, and so only TMNEXT types will appear, be suggested, autocompleted, etc.
Supporting MP4 and TURBO is possible but not planned unless there is demand. It's relatively simple if *simultaneous* parsing of TMNEXT/MP4/TURBO code isn't required.

You can load TURBO/MP4 game binding specifications by setting the openplanet directory to the one for that game and copying `Openplanet{Turbo,4}.json` to `OpenplanetNext.json`.

## Getting Started

This plugin should autodetect your OpenplanetNext folder and the Trackmania\Openplanet game folder, too.
If this doesn't work, then you'll need to add paths in the settings.

*Note:* if you are using this extension under vscode running in WSL, you should symlink `~/OpenplanetNext` to the corresponding directory in your userprofile dir for the default settings to work.
```bash
(
  OP_DIR="$(wslpath -u $(cmd.exe /C 'echo %userprofile%\\OpenplanetNext' 2>&1 | tr -d '\r' | tail -n1))";
  ln -s "$OP_DIR/" ~/OpenplanetNext;
)
```

To check if something's going wrong, look for logs in `Output > Angelscript Language Server`.

If you have issues ping @XertroV on the Openplanet discord.

<!--
**Note:** inline array declarations like `string[] asdf = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};` are taxing for the extension at the moment. This can cause out of memory errors for complex expressions like `string[][] = {{'a','b','c'},{'a','b','c'},{'a','b','c'},{'a','b','c'},{'a','b','c'},{'a','b','c'}}`.
The workaround is to populate the array with one array at a time using `.InsertLast`.
It's a bug. -->

## todo:

- check for redefinition of variables in same scope and squiggle
- annotation type add `@`
- add suggestions for settings keyword args (some done)
- fix/add `CoroutineFunc@` data types
- fix suggestions for fundefs -- way too many! (including missing some of the last characters + many many repetitions)
- class properties that are funcdef types should be registered as local functions
- cast to helper suggests pointless stuff for arrays (maybe other template types too)
- `void` as value for `&out` vars to ignore
- "Arguments can also be named and passed to a specific argument independent of the order the parameters were declared in. No positional arguments may follow any named arguments."
- `const obj @ const d = obj();` -- const syntax
- supertypes finish and polish (search for `.getSuperType()`; maybe remove .supertype all together in favor of .supertypes)
- rename getter/setter adds extra _ to start of usages
- (75%) list parsing v broken for complex expressions
- textDocument/completion failed with message: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'endsWith', 'length', and others)
- add UI function hints in addition to math hints
- long chains of `.Replace` on strings (e.g., 15+) are exponential to parse
- got some early crashes b/c dbParam in `ShouldLabelConstantNode(argNode, dbParam.name)` was null
